# PDFTool – Bill of Materials PDF Merger

**PDFTool** is a lightweight Windows application that automatically combines a multi-page *Bill of Materials (BOM)* PDF with a single *insert page*.

The result is a new PDF where each BOM page is immediately followed by the same insert page.

## 🔧 What does the tool do?

PDFTool creates a structured output PDF in the following order:

Page 1 – BOM page 1
Page 2 – Insert page
Page 3 – BOM page 2
Page 4 – Insert page
Page 5 – BOM page 3
Page 6 – Insert page
...


This is useful for:
- manufacturing documentation  
- technical drawings  
- internal project documentation  
- standardized approval or information pages
